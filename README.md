# Merge Sort Generator ðŸ§©

A simple JavaScript module that sorts arrays using the Merge Sort algorithm through recursive methods.

## What is Merge Sort?

- **Merge Sort** is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the sorted array.
- It is known for its efficiency and stability, making it a popular choice for sorting large datasets.

## The Takeaway

Creating the Merge Sort Generator deepened my understanding of various problem-solving approaches. Implementing the merge sort algorithm showcased the strengths of recursive methods and efficient array handling in JavaScript.

**Key points:**

- **Divide and Conquer:** Split the array into smaller subarrays, sort them individually, and merge them back in order.
  
- **Recursive Method:** Used recursion to break down the problem into manageable parts, enhancing my grasp of recursive thinking in JavaScript.
  
- **Merging Process:** Faced confusion about how arrays are merged by appending the smallest values from each subarray one by one until they were empty. An online visualizer clarified that the algorithm takes the smallest value from the front of each array during the merge.
  

Overall, this project enhanced my skills in algorithm design, recursive programming, and writing clean, efficient JavaScript code.


## Usage

```javascript
// Merge Function
function merge(left, right) {
  const sorted = [];

  while (left.length > 0 && right.length > 0) {
    sorted.push(left[0] <= right[0] ? left.shift() : right.shift());
  }

  return sorted.concat(left, right);
}

// Merge Sort Function
function mergeSort(arr) {
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;

  const mid = Math.ceil(arr.length / 2);
  const left = arr.slice(0, mid);
  const right = arr.slice(mid, arr.length);

  return merge(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right));
}

// Example Usage
const unsortedArray = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10];
const sortedArray = mergeSort(unsortedArray);
console.log(sortedArray); // [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
